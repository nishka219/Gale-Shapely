# Gale-Shapely
A greedy algorithm is an algorithmic paradigm that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope offinding a global optimum. 

The Gale-Shapley Algorithm does exactly that. At each step, the 'proposers' take a greedy decision of selecting the best partner (locally optimal choice) that was not yet proposed.
